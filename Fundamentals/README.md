# Fundamentals

**1. Images**

In general sense, Images are just a represtation of anything which need to be replicated for later purpose. 

Examples:
1. A phptograph is a 2D image, a replica of any thing that we store to use for later purposes.

2. A statue is a 3D image.

3. Even a song is an image in that sense.

In computing sense, an Image is just a mapping function, `F(x,y,z, ..)`. 

If we consider a photograph Its a 2D function `F(x,y)` where each element's value is `value = F(x,y)` where `x,y` is a position in the image.

Officially we call it `Digital Image` because the defining function i.e. `F(x,y)` is a digital function, what we mean by that is, the return value is finite and discrete.
